# LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository is for daily LeetCode problem-solving practice.

## Workflow

1. **Daily Practice**
   - Try to solve at least one LeetCode problem every day after work
   - Consistency is key to improving problem-solving skills

2. **Difficulty Progression**
   - Start with Easy problems and gradually move to Medium and Hard
   - Don't give up when facing difficult problems
   - Take breaks and return with a fresh perspective

3. **Using LeetCode VSCode Plugin**
   - Install the [LeetCode VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode)
   - Solve problems directly in VSCode
   - The extension provides a convenient interface for browsing and solving problems

4. **Commit Code**
   - After solving a problem, use Claude Code to commit your solution
   - Command: `claude -p "/commit-code"`
   - This will automatically add all changes, create an AI-generated commit message, and push to the repository
